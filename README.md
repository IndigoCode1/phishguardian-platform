PhishGuardian is an open-source, AI-powered phishing simulation platform designed specifically for small businesses (SMBs). It leverages generative AI to create realistic phishing emails, allowing organizations to train their employees, track responses, and improve overall cybersecurity awareness in a safe, controlled environment.
Features (Current Demo State):
*   **AI-Generated Phishing Emails:** Utilizes OpenAI's API (GPT-4o) to automatically generate realistic email subjects and bodies based on user-defined scenarios.
*   **Campaign Management API:** Backend endpoints to create campaigns (defining scenario, recipients) and trigger email sending.
*   **Email Delivery:** Sends simulated phishing emails via a configurable SMTP server (defaults to MailHog for local testing).
*   **Click & Submission Tracking:** Embeds unique tracking links in emails. Logs clicks and fake credential submissions (without storing actual credentials).
*   **AI-Generated Feedback:** Provides immediate educational feedback (phishing tips generated by AI) to users after they submit credentials on the fake login page.
*   **Basic Reporting Dashboard:** A simple web page displaying key statistics (recipients, clicks, submissions, rates) for a specific campaign, including a visual chart.
*   **Dockerized Deployment:** Uses Docker Compose for easy setup of the backend, database, and email catching service.
